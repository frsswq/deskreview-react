Have you ever had a sudden, almost lightning-bolt-like existential crisis? Moments when you stand still on both of your feet, realizing that every muscle in your body is literally pulled and released by the order of your brain, and then realizing what a brain even is and what consciousness even is? Layer upon layer of that realization until it makes you nauseous (in the Sartrean sense) and dizzy from your own condition.

I was at a far-left cafe/communal space called Kongsi 8 in East Jakarta, wearing Silent Disco shiny green headphones and listening to weird “bio-sonic” synth music produced by plant electrical waves transmitted by sophisticated wires and machines when it happened. As quirky and unreal as it sounds, I felt like I was experiencing an absolute “human experience” in the most concrete way possible. Choreographed by the previously meditated affirmation of total human expression, I found myself dancing and jumping in a small sweaty dark room with ten other people. I gazed around the room and witnessed at least three people in a transcendental arm-swaying dance, two people standing still with their eyes closed, a mother and daughter dancing and laughing joyfully while holding hands, and three more dancing in more socially acceptable club-ready moves. Nobody was under the influence of substances (as written and announced in the house rules), but in many senses, it seemed too “liberalized” and too expressive for the mundane everyday Muslim-populated country norm I witnessed every day. At the end of my gaze, I already felt like ‘this is the exact photographic memory I’ll remember as my “human experience” milliseconds before I die.’ It’s hard to keep this writing objective when what I experienced was as chilling as what I just said.

Human culture, in general, is a very complicated topic. It is unfair to even start the notion of “which is better, STEM or Social Science?”. Anyone sensitive to social phenomena is equally blessed as anyone studying physics or AI. In a fully conscious mind: Aesthetica and the sensation of human beauty transcend beyond those boring academic debates. It is beyond good or bad, right or wrong, tasteful or disgusting, beautiful or ugly, stupid or smart, or any other dualism that has ever existed. Aesthetica itself was described etymologically as “stimulation of the five senses,” and primarily explained by Alexander Gottlieb as “study about good and bad ‘taste’”. Aesthetica defines the unexplainable sensory sensations a human can receive without any unnecessary rational process; you are supposed to just surrender to the beauty of it. “Surrender” is a beautiful word, isn’t it?

> “Surrender” is a beautiful word, isn’t it?

The aesthetic experience I had back at Kongsi 8 was highly triggered by the music, the method, the place, and the people I met there. It was hardly explainable and undeniably will never happen again in the exact same form. That’s the sort of beauty of Aesthetica, I suppose: every sensation is a complex stimulant produced by millions of almost-random stimulus variables miraculously happening at that very moment. It was purely a gift from God, which we have to embrace and celebrate as part of the daily chores of being a mortal human.
